# IBM-Python-analysis

Learn how to analyze data using Python. This course will take you from the basics of Python to exploring many different types of data.<br> You will learn how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualizations, <br> predict future trends from data, and more!

### Topics covered:

1) Importing Datasets<br> 
2) Cleaning the Data<br> 
3) Data frame manipulation<br> 
4) Summarizing the Data<br> 
5) Building machine learning Regression models<br> 
6) Building data pipelines<br> 

 ### Data Analysis with Python will be delivered through lecture, lab, and assignments. It includes following parts:

Data Analysis libraries: will learn to use Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries to work with a sample dataset. <br> We will introduce you to pandas, an open-source library, and we will use it to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets. <br> Then we will introduce you to another open-source library, scikit-learn, and we will use some of its machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions.<br> 

If you choose to take this course and earn the Coursera course certificate, you will also earn an IBM digital badge.
